# Python Programming Task 1

This folder contains the initial set of coding challenges designed to assess and strengthen fundamental Python programming skills. The tasks range from basic syntax to intermediate array manipulation and logic.

## 📂 File Contents

This directory includes two Jupyter Notebooks:

### 1. Programming_task_1(Basic_Python_Prohramming).ipynb

This notebook covers the essentials of Python syntax.

#### Topics Covered:
Standard Output ("Hello, World!")
Conditional Logic (if-else statements)
Arithmetic Operators and Division (Integer vs Float)
Loops and Iteration
Function definition (Leap Year logic)

### 2. Python_Programming_Task 1( advance Python).ipynb

Despite the title, this notebook focuses on algorithmic thinking and array manipulation (LeetCode-style problems).

#### Key Problems Solved:
Running Sum of 1d Array: Calculating the cumulative sum of a list.
Shuffle the Array: Reordering elements based on specific index logic.
Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies: Boolean logic applied to array elements.

### 🛠 Prerequisites & Dependencies

To run these files, you need a Python environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks.
Python: Version 3.x

Interface: Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, or VS Code (with Jupyter extension).

### 🚀 How to Run

##### Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>


##### Navigate to this folder:
cd "Tasks and Assignments/Python Programming Task 1"


#### Launch Jupyter:
jupyter notebook

Open the desired .ipynb file from the browser interface to view and execute the cells.
