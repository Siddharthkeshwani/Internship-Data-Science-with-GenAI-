# Python Programming Task 2

This folder contains the second module of the internship. This section dives deeper into **Data Structures** (Dictionaries/Hash Maps), **String Manipulation**, and intermediate **Array Logic**.

## 📂 File Contents

### `Programming Task - 2(for Advance (EDA) Python Programmers .ipynb`

This notebook tackles 6 distinct algorithmic problems:

* **String Manipulation**:
    * *Defanging an IP Address*: Replacing `.` with `[.]` to prevent execution.
* **Mathematical Logic & Iteration**:
    * *Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits*: Extracting digits from an integer to perform calculations.
    * *Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits*: Analyzing integer length constraints.
    * *XOR Operation in an Array*: Performing bitwise XOR on a generated sequence.
* **Hash Maps & Frequency Counting**:
    * *Number of Good Pairs*: Identifying identical pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
    * *How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number*: Ranking elements against the rest of the array.

## 🧠 What I Learned
* **String Methods**: Using `.replace()` and type casting for digit manipulation.
* **Bitwise Operations**: Understanding the XOR (`^`) operator.
* **Optimization**: Using Dictionaries (Hash Maps) to count frequencies instead of using nested loops ($O(n)$ vs $O(n^2)$).

## 🛠 Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Navigate to this folder.
2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
3.  Open `Programming Task - 2(for Advance (EDA) Python Programmers .ipynb` to execute the cells.
